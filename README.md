This Python package is an <i>helping hand</i> to all data analyst and scientist that are trying to assess scientifically how many call center agents to staff ! ðŸ”¥

The main teory under the hood has been developed in by Mr. Agner Krarup Erlang - who, back in the 1916, developed the concept of <i>Erlang Unit Measure</i> - and by Mr. Conny Palm - back in the 1942.

If we think about calls arriving into a call center we could think about their distribution in time like if it were a <i>Poisson Distribution</i>.
By having the incoming call one could assess how many agents are needed in order to answer the <i>Erlang measure of <b>offered load</b> (i.e. arriving calls !)</i>.
